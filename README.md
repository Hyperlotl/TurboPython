TurboPython is a Turbowarp extension that allows you to leverage python scripts by running multiple at the same time. (problably, untested) It's sort of like python but block-based.
Note: the time extension("import time") and the print function don't work. For the print function, just remove the print. =)
# Notes on version:
TurboPython_beta.js is a stable proof of concept. You can only run one script.
TurboPython_V1.js is the current version. It is the one the description is referring to.
